# ZEI (Zeus/Eden Interiors)

Spawn furniture and populate areas via in-game modules.<br>
This is a stand-alone add-on, when used in Eden it creates no dependencies - Players will NOT require this add-on when playing your missions.

When any building is populated with a module, the buildings damage is disabled to prevent floating objects.<br>
When the area module is used a flag is also set to prevent the building from being re-decorated if you use the module multiple times.
